This web app should support the following features : Add new notes, Edit old notes, Delete old notes, Sort notes by newest first or oldest first. ( 10 marks for each + 10 marks for design ).

__Sample code using JQuery to interact with the backend.__


1. Authenticating the app

var obj = {
	email 	: 'quotemridul@gmail.com',
	rollNo 	: '14MT10024'
};
$.post( "http://www.eduspectrum.com/api/authenticate.php", obj, function( data ) {
	// To view your sessionId
	console.log(data.sessionId);
});

// Here data is an object that contains a sessionId.

2. Getting all posts 

var obj = {
	sessionId : 'YourSessionId obtained earlier',
	rollNo : 'Your roll number'
}
$.post( "http://www.eduspectrum.com/api/getAll.php", obj, function( data ) {
	var newObj = JSON.parse(data);
	for(var i=0; i < newObj.length; i++) {
		console.log(newObj[i]);
	}
});

// The data returned is an array of objects. Each object contains a title, a description and a createdAt field. 

3. Create Post
var post = {
	sessionId : 'YourSessionId obtained earlier',
	rollNo : 'Your roll number',
	title : 'Post Title',
	description : 'Description of the post.'
}
$.post( "http://www.eduspectrum.com/api/create.php", post, function(data) {
	console.log(data);
})

// Here data is the object. It will contain a description, a title and a createdAt field. You do not need to send in this data. It will be added by the server and returned to you. You need to manage displaying this data though.

4. Delete Post
var post = {
	sessionId : 'YourSessionId obtained earlier',
	rollNo	: 'Your roll number'
	createdAt : 'The created at time.'
}
$.post( "http://www.eduspectrum.com/api/delete.php", post, function(data) {
	console.log(data);
})

// If data == true post was deleted successfully otherwise there was some error.
